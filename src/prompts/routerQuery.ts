				"What is the prescription drug compensation for the BCBSSC network?"
				"What is the definition of Specialty Drugs?"
				"What are the drug prices for caremark in 2024?"
				"What are the brand rates for CVS Specialty drugs in 2023"
		'PARSE_SEARCH_QUERY': This route is for global searches based on the user input. This will be for multiple files. Examples of questions that fall under this route include:
				"List all contracts with effective date in 2024"
				"List all contracts that mention flu vaccines"
				"Give me Walgreens contracts"
	For any ambiguous queries that might fit either route, default to 'MODIFY_QUERY_WITH_HISTORY'. Only respond with one of the routes defined and explained.
